This application visualizes the change in major trading partners across the world. The data it uses is from the International Monetary Fund Direction of Trade Statistics.
The colors represent the percent of Cost, Insurance, and Freight (CIF) in USD from either the EU, US, or China (Whichever has a highest value for a given country).

If you only want the plots, they can be found at imports_app/plots. The Jupyter Notebook (if you run all) will automatically collect, process, and create plots for any new data that the IMF has made available
through their public API (2.0). Please note that creating the resolution of the data is currently at the month level.
